# STM32 Environmental Monitor Board

The **STM32 Environmental Monitor Board** is a user-developed PCB aimed at environmental temperature monitoring, with a focus on accurate temperature measurement. The board leverages the STM32 microcontroller to provide precise, reliable sensing and high-speed communication features, making it ideal for both prototyping and embedded systems design.

## Features

- **STM32 Microcontroller**: Central processing unit for data acquisition, processing, and communication.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Interfaces with temperature sensors to provide accurate environmental measurements.
- **VDDA Filtering**: Analog power filtering to ensure stable and noise-immune ADC readings.
- **Crystal Oscillator**: External crystal oscillator for high-quality clock generation and improved timing accuracy.
- **Decoupling Capacitors**: Strategically placed capacitors to suppress voltage ripple and maintain stable operation.
- **Communication Interfaces**:
  - **USART Pins**: For serial communication and debugging purposes.
  - **I2C2 Pins**: Allows interfacing with additional sensors or modules.
- **Expandable**: Can accommodate additional environmental sensors or peripheral devices.
- **Compact PCB Design**: Optimized layout for signal integrity and minimal noise interference.

## Applications

- Data logging and analysis of temperature and related environmental parameters

## Getting Started

1. **Power the Board**: Provide the recommended voltage supply to the board.
2. **Connect Communication Interfaces**: Connect USART or I2C2 pins for sensor integration or debugging.
3. **Load Firmware**: Flash the firmware onto the STM32 using your preferred IDE (STM32CubeIDE or PlatformIO).
4. **Start Monitoring**: Consume temperature data and integrate it into your application or logging system.

## Design Considerations

- **Power Integrity**: VDDA filtering and decoupling capacitors minimize noise in analog measurements.
- **Timing Accuracy**: External crystal oscillator ensures precise timing for sensor readings and communications.

## Future Improvements

- Integration of additional environmental sensors (humidity, air quality)
